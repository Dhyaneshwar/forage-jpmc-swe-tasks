# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

## Here is the background information of task 1
To assist with some development to add a chart to a traderâ€™s dashboard allowing them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.

The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualise when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

Most data visualisation for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualisation software, which is now open source.

## Here's what you need to do
For this task we will need to accomplish the following:

- Set up your local dev environment by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
- Fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository by making the required adjustments to it.
- Generate a patch file of the changes you made

## Set up dev environment
Execute the below command to run the server and client

1. python server3.py
2. python client3.py

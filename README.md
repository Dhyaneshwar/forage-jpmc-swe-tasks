# JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program

This repository contains my solutions for the JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program. Through this program, I gained practical experience by completing tasks that simulate real-world challenges faced by software engineers at JPMorgan Chase. Each task is designed to enhance specific technical skills and provide insight into the work culture at JPMorgan Chase.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main tasks, each placed in its respective folder:

- `swe-task-1`: Interface with a Stock Price Data Feed
- `swe-task-2`: Use JPMorgan Chase & Co. Frameworks and Tools
- `swe-task-3`: Display Data Visually for Traders

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Interface with a Stock Price Data Feed
- **Folder:** `swe-task-1`
- **Objective:** Set up a local development environment and interface with a stock price data feed.
- **Key Learnings:** 
  - How software engineers help JPMorgan Chase traders by building dashboards to better identify under/over-valued stocks.
  - Setting up a development environment by installing Python, forking and cloning the starter repo, and installing project dependencies.
  - Understanding the structure and purpose of an engineering ticket.
- **Activities:**
  - Download and install the necessary files, tools, and dependencies.
  - Fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository.
  - Optionally add unit tests in the test script in the repository.

### Task 2: Use JPMorgan Chase & Co. Frameworks and Tools
- **Folder:** `swe-task-2`
- **Objective:** Implement the Perspective open-source code in preparation for data visualization.
- **Key Learnings:** 
  - How to install npm to work in JavaScript.
  - The reasons behind JPMorgan Chase creating Perspective and its value as an open-source library.
- **Activities:**
  - Set up the local development environment.
  - Fix broken TypeScript files in the repository to ensure the web application outputs correctly.

### Task 3: Display Data Visually for Traders
- **Folder:** `swe-task-3`
- **Objective:** Use Perspective to create a live data visualization chart for a trading dashboard.
- **Key Learnings:** 
  - How traders use a trading dashboard for trading analysis and stock price monitoring.
- **Activities:**
  - Set up the system by downloading the necessary files, tools, and dependencies.
  - Use Perspective to generate a live graph that displays a data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to monitor.
